This folder contains my solutions for the Homework 2 of the Machine Learning Course, I have trained four different networks and evaludated them with simple hold-out validation in the first notebook and then the best network is chosen to be evaluated with k-fold validation in the second notebook 

[Part 1 (Simple Hold-out Validation)](https://github.com/minaraaz/MachineLearningCourse/blob/master/HW2/HW2-Part1.ipynb)
